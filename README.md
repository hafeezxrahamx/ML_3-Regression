# ML_3-Regression
Regression Assignment

Objective

The objective of this assignment is to evaluate the understanding of regression techniques in supervised learning by applying them to a real-world dataset.

Dataset

The California Housing dataset available in the sklearn library is used for this assignment. This dataset contains information about various features of houses in California and their respective median prices.

Key Components

1. Loading and Preprocessing: Load the California Housing dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature scaling.
2. Regression Algorithm Implementation: Implement Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR).
3. Model Evaluation and Comparison: Evaluate the performance of each algorithm using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared Score (RÂ²).

Implementation

The implementation is done in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
